Summoner Skill Concepts(Subject to change and or objection):

-->SUMMONER(A being who specializes in summoning powerful creatures to aid in combat)
 Passive:
>Shepard of minions- Summoner gains 1% bonus max health per minion spawned
->bonus max health scales with level at max rank 5% bonus max health per minion

>Spawner- Grants +1 minion summon per 100 mana
->nothing scales with level this passive only takes 1 skill point

 Attack skill:
>Infestation- Causes bleeding or poisoned debuff for 10 seconds if minions attack the same target 5-10 times
-> Can only happen every 20 seconds per enemy
-> Duration of debuff scales with level at max rank 20 seconds(Completely cancels out the cooldown)

 Active:
>"Power Exchange"- Summoner sacrifices 20% of max health to give a 50% damage boost to summon damage (Can cause player death if used at very low health)
->Health Sacrifice and summon damage boost both scale with rank, 50% health sacrifice at max level and 100% boost in summon damage at max level
->30 second cool down
->10-20 sec duration scale with rank

>"Pain Disperse"- Minions take .5% damage per summon that was intended for the summoner.(Basic Terms: Summoner completely ignores a percentage of damage that would normally hit(Example:Fire ball that does 10 damage would do 7.5 damage if summoner has 50 minions. Thats a 25% reduciton to all damage))
->Damage dispersed scales with level at max rank 1.5% per minion
->1:00 cooldown
->30 sec duration(does NOT scale with level)
