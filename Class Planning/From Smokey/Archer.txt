Archer Skill Concepts(Subject to change and or objection):

-->ARCHER(Bow/Crossbow user that is nimble and is accurate with arrows)-
 Passive:
>Night Hunter- Archer turns invisible,invincible and loses aggro for 1 second when killing a enemy with a crit attack.
->duration of invisibilty can scale with level so at max rank 5 seconds
->This passive could be restricted to night time only possibly

>Kill Confirmed- After killing a enemy the archer gains a 5-15% movement speed buff for 5 seconds.
->movement speed scales with rank
-
 Attack skill:
>Bullseye- attacking the same enemy 5 times applys stacks of Bullseye which deal bonus true damage/unresistable damage to target when hitting the fifth attack.
(downside is that it can only be applied to one target at a time)(Also its a constant attack passive so it does not have a cooldown it resets everytime the player reaches the 5th attack)(Also if the target that first gets the stack of bullseye isnt attacked in the next 5 seconds the stacks disapear and can be applied to another enemy)
->Skill only applies to arrow projectiles
->The amount of true damage starts at 10 and scales to 50 at max rank.
-
 Active skill:
>"Heavy arrow"- Sends out a arrow that has alot of knock back and stuns enemies if they are sent flying into a wall.
->10-15 sec cooldown
->30 mana cost

>"Tactical BackFlip/Back Dodge"- Archer dodges backwards avoiding damage and gives player a 10-20% movement speed boost for 5 seconds.(Movement speed scales threw ranks/points invested)
->6 sec cooldown
->10 mana cost
